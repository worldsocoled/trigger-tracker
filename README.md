# Trigger Tracker

**Trigger Tracker** is a Python-based application designed to help users log and reflect on their personal triggers throughout the day. By capturing details such as the trigger itself, surrounding events, and emotional responses, the app makes it easier to identify patterns and share insights with a therapist.

This project demonstrates practical Python skills, data handling, modular design, and data visualization.
